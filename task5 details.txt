Credit Card Fraud Detection

Task 05 : Problem Statement

1.Build a machine learning model to identify fradulent credit card transactions.
2.Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class inbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3.Train a classification algorithm,such as logistic regression or random forests to classify transactions as fraudelent or genuine.
4.Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and f1-score and cosider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.
